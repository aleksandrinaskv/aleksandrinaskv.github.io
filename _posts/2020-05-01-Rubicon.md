I am happy to announce that I have received a Rubicon fellowship from NWO (Dutch Research Council). This fellowship gives me an opportunity to join the Pain Genetics Lab of McGill University and work under the supervision of prof. Jeffrey Mogil. During the coming two years I will do research on the effects of stress and sex hormones on pain memory. It is a great opportunity for me to combine my interests in classical conditioning and psychoendocrinology.
