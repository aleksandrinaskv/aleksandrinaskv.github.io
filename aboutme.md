title: About me
---

My name is Aleksandrina. I am a postdoctoral researcher and a Rubicon fellow working in the Pain Genetics Lab of Mc Gill University.
I am interested in how expectations and previous experiences influence health and disease. I study this topic from different perspectives and do research on:
- Placebo and nocebo effects
- Classical conditioning of hormonal responses
- Classical conditioning of pain and pain memory
- Expectations manipulations aimed to improve treatment outcomes

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
